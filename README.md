# FoxRabbitSim
pygame module required
A simulation of foxes and rabbits inspired by the Lotka-Volterra equations. The idea is as follows: white pixels represent rabbits, red pixels represent foxes, and green pixels represent grass. The rabbits eat grass, foxes eat rabbits, and rabbits/foxes will die if not given food in a given amount of time.

2 year edit: 
This was one of my first projects ever! So I'm keeping it here for posterity. Yes, the code is atrocious. If you use VSCode, try not to use debug mode since it will be rather laggy.
